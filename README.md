# student-knowledge-assessment-using-machine-learning
In this study , we developed a  deep learning 1D CNN model for student knowledge assessment using the UCI Student Knowledge Dataset achieved an impressive accuracy of 97%. 

Our model architecture utilized Conv1D layers, MaxPooling1D layers, Dropout layers, Flatten layers, and Dense layers with appropriate activation functions to achieve the desired performance. We also used hyperparameters such as learning rate and epochs to optimize the training process.

our model demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques for accurately predicting student performance based on academic data. This could be useful for educational institutions and policymakers in identifying at-risk students and implementing targeted interventions to improve academic outcomes.
